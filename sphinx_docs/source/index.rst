What is Path Planning?
----------------------
Path planning is responsible for determining a route for the car to take in order to navigate the track. This process involves two primary parts: determining the midline and employing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to determine the structure of the racetrack and the location of the car. Determining the midline refers to the process of generating a route between the blue and yellow cones observed at the current time step. The midline is necessary when the car is competing its first lap around the track because without knowledge of the track's layout, the car is forced to naively navigate the track. As the car completes its first lap, a SLAM algorithm is employed to refine its position in the track and the position of previously seen cones (localization) based on newly observed cones while also mapping out the racetrack (mapping).

This is made possible by processing observed cone positions received from our Perceptions pipeline into a path the car can follow. The Planning pipelines is then responsible for a.) determining the midline, a series of points representing the path the car should take b.) SLAM. The path is published and received by the Controls Pipeline where control actions will be determined to instruct the car to follow the route indicated by the spline. The map of the racetrack generated by SLAM will be used in the laps following the first lap to navigate the track.
